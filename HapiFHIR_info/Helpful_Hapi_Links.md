#Helpful links and info with HapiFHIR.
* [java docs for 
resources](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs-dstu2/index.html)
* [java docs in general for the DSTU2 
model](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/apidocs-dstu2/index.html) I 
don't believe we will need much from anything other than the resource 
portion at this point.
* [HapiFHIR releases](https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/releases)
