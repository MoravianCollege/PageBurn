## Helpful

* [FHIR Datatypes](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#HumanName/)


## Ok


* [HL7 FHIR Webinar by HL7 FHIR Governance Board Co-Chair and Corepoint Health CTO Dave Shaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVif_-ya8I0) - This video gives a high-level overview of FHIR and where it sits within the world of medical data representation.  Worthwhile for big picture information, but limited technical details (BJC)

* From Jaffie: There are many open source fhir implementations that you can download and test.. [here’s a popular one](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/).   Please note.. FHIR is a spec much like java api is a spec. The implementor may choose any tech stack to implement. Since there are some open source implementation already out there, like HAPI, etc, I would suggest use this as your base implementation server.
