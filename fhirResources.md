## Ok

This one is the most helpful link I’ve found on FHIR. It breaks down all 
resources into readable objects with UML diagrams. When you look at any 
of the sections with multiple tabs ALWAYS hit the ALL tab. It gives you 
the information in an easier to read and understand format. A word of 
caution this link is daunting. I have not been able to get through all 
of it but it gives you examples and even if you just glance over the 
information you will learn a lot. These are the datatypes that make up 
all of the resources. Some are modified to fit whatever the resource 
needs.
* [HL7 FHIR Webinar by HL7 FHIR Governance Board Co-Chair and Corepoint Health CTO Dave Shaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVif_-ya8I0) - This video gives a high-level overview of FHIR and where it sits within the world of medical data representation.  Worthwhile for big picture information, but limited technical details (BJC)

## Other

This is the link to the validator. LOOK DOWN TO THE CENTER OF THE PAGE. 
It gives you command line instructions that you can follow. It’s in 
Windows commands only in the sense that Windows comes with wget. If you 
have a Mac and Homebrew installed you can do brew install wget. I’ve 
gotten mixed results with actually getting the validator to work. If you 
follow the instructions you shouldn’t have a problem.

* From Jaffie: There are many open source fhir implementations that you can download and test.. [here’s a popular one](http://jamesagnew.github.io/hapi-fhir/).   Please note.. FHIR is a spec much like java api is a spec. The implementor may choose any tech stack to implement. Since there are some open source implementation already out there, like HAPI, etc, I would suggest use this as your base implementation server.
