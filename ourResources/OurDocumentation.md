#Our Resources Overview

This directory is intended to be a home for our resources that we are 
playing with to try to make pass the validator. It is also a home for 
any other resources we are trying to work with to get the final copies 
ready.

**Basic Practitioner**
* I used the Docgraph data from the medicare file of the original data 
directory. I used the head command and manually translated fields that 
existed and used an example file provided by FHIR as a basis for this.
* Note, this is a very bare minimum that doesn't use all of the DocGraph 
data.
* The validator issues warnings becuase I do not have valid URI's for 
some of the fields for it to check against valid data however, it DOES 
pass the validator. After running the bottom line says ... success.
